I will be mainly working with the sample data bases from the internet - HR database ( can be found on GitHub) as well as world and sakila databases.
Most of the questions and queries I will present are from various websites for SQL training (W3 schools, W3 resuorces) but also from some books I have read. In most cases I will make notes about from where I got those resources. 

Basic SQL statements, and present in 99% of all queries are

select ...


from ...


where...

group by ....

order by...

limit ... 

and the variations of it.
